    "* **Functions**: A function is a block of reusable code designed to perform a specific task. Functions provide modularity to the code, making it easier to understand, maintain, and reuse.\n",
    "* **Arguments**: function arguments are the values that you pass to a function when calling it. Functions can have parameters, which act as placeholders for these arguments. Parameters are specified in the function definition, and arguments are the actual values or variables that are passed into the function.\n",
    "* **Boolean**: In Python, the Boolean type is a built-in data type that represents the two truth values: `True` and `False`. Booleans are often used in conditional expressions and logical operations to make decisions and control the flow of a program.\n",
    "* **Conditional statements**  Allow to control the flow of the program based on certain conditions. They enable decision making and execute different code blocks depending on whether a specified condition evaluates to `True` or `False`."
